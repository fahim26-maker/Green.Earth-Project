<!-- Q1 is -->
Difference between var, let and const is :
- var is function-scoped, meaning itâ€™s only accessible within the function where itâ€™s declared, and it can be re-declared and updated freely.
- let is block-scoped, so it only exists within the {} block it's defined in, and while it can be updated, it cannot be re-declared in the same scope.
- const is also block-scoped, but unlike let, it must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be updated or re-declared.
In short: var is loose and risky, let is flexible and modern, and const is strict and reliable. weâ€™ll mostly use let for dynamic values and const for fixed ones like DOM selectors or config settings.

<!-- Q-2 is -->
 Difference between map(), forEach(), and filter() is :
 - forEach() executes a function on each element of an array but doesnâ€™t return anything â€” itâ€™s mainly used for side effects like logging or DOM updates.
- map() also runs a function on each element, but it returns a new array with the transformed values, making it ideal for data conversion or formatting.
- filter() checks each element against a condition and returns a new array containing only the elements that pass that test.
In short:
ðŸ‘‰ forEach() is for doing something with each item,
ðŸ‘‰ map() is for transforming items into a new array,
ðŸ‘‰ filter() is for selecting specific items based on a condition.
Want to try applying all three to a DOM-based list or spinner logic to see how they behave differently?

Arrow function E6 is:
- Arrow functions use the => syntax, which makes code shorter and cleaner â€” especially useful when  working with callbacks like in map(), filter(), or event listeners.
- They donâ€™t require the function keyword, and if the function body is a single expression, It can even skip the curly braces and return keyword.
- Arrow functions donâ€™t have their own this context, which means they inherit this from their surrounding scope â€” super handy when dealing with DOM events or nested functions.

<!-- Q4 -->
- Destructuring allows to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a single, clean line of code.
- In array destructuring, the position of each value matters â€” values are unpacked based on their index.
- In object destructuring, the variable names must match the property names of the object, unless you rename them using a colon.
- It can also set default values during destructuring, which will be used if the original value is undefined.
- Destructuring makes code more readable and reduces repetition, especially when working with complex data like API responses or DOM elements.

<!-- Q-5 -->
Hereâ€™s a clear, sentence-by-sentence explanation of template literals in ES6 and how they differ from traditional string concatenation:

- Template literals are a modern way to write strings using backticks (`) instead of quotes, allowing for cleaner and more readable syntax.
- They let you embed variables directly inside the string using ${} without breaking the string or using the + operator.
- Unlike string concatenation, template literals support multi-line strings naturally, so you donâ€™t need to use \n or join multiple lines manually.
- Template literals are especially useful when building dynamic HTML or logging complex messages, because they reduce clutter and improve readability.
- String concatenation uses + to join strings and variables, which can get messy and hard to follow when dealing with multiple values or long lines.
- In short, template literals make your code more elegant and easier to maintain, especially in DOM manipulation or UI rendering tasks.
